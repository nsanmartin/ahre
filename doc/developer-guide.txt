Function Naming
===============

All functions and methods are written in snake case.

Functions with internal-linkage are surrounded by underscores, e.g.:
_convert_to_utf8_.

Methods (functions tightly associated to types) start with the type name
in snake case (types are in "Pascal" case), e.g.:
htmldoc_init (is the init function of Htmldoc type).

In implementation files, internal-linkage functions came before 
external-linkage functions after the comment /* internal linkage */.
Then came the external-linkage functions after the comment 
/* external linkage */.


Generation of text representation
=================================

Html document is parsed by lexbor library (https://lexbor.com/).

{#TODO: After parsing the html document, quickjs-ng (https://quickjs-ng.github.io/quickjs/)
is used to evaluate the javascript and apply the changes in the document.}

htmldoc_draw "draws" the document as text traversing the tree parsed by lexbor. It calls 
draw_rec_tag to draw each elemment and for each tag T draw_tag_T and draw_text for text.
