Ahre can be launched without parameters (./ahre ) or specifying a url, ie:
> ./ahre file:///home/user/file.txt

If schema is not provided, https is assumed. So 
> ./ahre curl.se
assumes https://curl.se

Ahre commands.

Set the url:
url      :  shows the url of the current document
url <URL>:  sets current doc's url to <URL> and fetches it.
browse   :  generate textbuffer for html document.
go <URL> :  sets the url of the current doc with <URL>, fetches and browses it (it does not show it).

colon (:) commands: 
Simmilarly to vim, commands starting with colon are buffer commands. After ':'
a range and a command are expected and the current line is set with the end of the range.

:%p     : prints the whole buffer, sets current line with $.
:,+34p  : prints from the current line to 34 lines after it, moves current line 34.
:,$n    : print from current line until the last one, numbering the printed lines, move the current line.
:1p     : prints first line and set the current line.
:write /home/user/buffer : saves current buffer in target (without the escape sequences bash uses for the colours).

In ahre, some tags are wrapped with specific chars:
anchors are wrapped within [] 
inputs are wrapped within {}
images are wrapped within ()

inside of which a number (base 36) identifies the element and its text is displayed.

This chars are used to indicate specific commands:

anchor commands ([)
[<ID>' : shows content of anchor with id = <ID>
[<ID>* : sets current buffer with anchor's href url fetches and browses it.

input commands ({)
{<ID>=<VALUE>   : sets input with is = <ID> calue with <VALUE>. This applies
                  only to text inputs and is used to fill inputs in forms.
{<ID>*<VALUE>   : submits button input with id=<ID>. Applied only to submit inputs.
