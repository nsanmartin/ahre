Ahre can be launched without parameters (./ahre ) or specifying a url, ie:
> ./ahre file:///home/user/file.txt

If schema is not provided, https is assumed. So 
> ./ahre curl.se
assumes https://curl.se

In ahre, some tags are wrapped with specific chars:
+ anchors are wrapped within [] 
+ inputs are wrapped within {}
+ images are wrapped within ()
inside of which a number (base 36) identifies the element and its text is
displayed.

This chars are used to indicate specific commands like for example the
line `[1f*` is used to follow the link with id 1f (see later).

There are also shortcut commands aimed to save keystrokes such as `zf` (see
later).

You don't need to type the full command if there is no ambiguity. Hence,
`b` will be interpreted as `browse` (unless we implement a new doc command 
beginning with b).

Ahre commands
=============

browse   :  generate text buffer for html document.
go <URL> :  sets the url of the current doc with <URL>, fetches and browses it
            (it does not show it).

colon (:) commands 
==================

Similarly to vim, commands starting with colon are buffer commands. After ':'
a range and a command are expected and the current line is set with the end of
the range.

:%p     : prints the whole buffer, sets current line with $.
:,+34p  : prints from the current line to 34 lines after it, moves current line 34.
:,$n    : print from current line until the last one, numbering the printed
          lines, move the current line.
:1p     : prints first line and set the current line.

:write <PATH> : saves current buffer in target (without the escape
                sequences bash uses for the colours).

:^      : repeat last range used (for example :^n after :2,5 will be :2,5n).

less than (<) commands:
======================

These are similar to (:) but operates on the source (html) buffer.

anchor commands ([)
===================

[<ID>' : shows content of anchor with id = <ID>
[<ID>* : sets current buffer with anchor's href url fetches and browses it.
[<ID>? : print information about element (attributes)

input commands ({)
==================

{<ID>=<VALUE>   : sets input with is = <ID> value with <VALUE>. This applies
                  only to text inputs and is used to fill inputs in forms.
{<ID>*<VALUE>   : submits button input with id=<ID>. Applied only to submit
                  inputs.
{<ID>?          : print information about element (attributes)

pipe commands (|)
=================

Pipe commands switch between tabs. Tabs have each one its history. It is a tree
where each document is a node. When following a link, a child is appended, when 
navigating back, precious document is set current.

|-      : goes back in history
|?      : displays each tab with its history
|2      : switchs to third tab
|0.1.2. : switchs to first tab and navigates to third link of second link in history

dot commands (.)
================

.?  : shows info about the document

shortcuts
=========

zf [<NUM>}] : shortcut to :,+<NUM>p but setting NUM so that it does not exceeds
              line count and prints a message when already reached the last
              line. If num is not given the last one provided in a previous
              call is used (with a default value if it was not called).

bookmarks
=========

bookmarks file is an html file the same as w3m's. The idea is to be able to share
the bookmark between both programs. There is an "alias" got the bookmarks file so

go \b

will open it ('\' followed by anu substring og 'bookmarks' will work).

To append the url of a document you can use the dot command:
.+<SECTION>

where '+' indicate "add to bookmars" and <SECTION> can be one of:
1. a string starting with '/'
2. a string not starting with '/'

If (1.), for example, .+/foo, a section whos name starts with foo is sought.
Only if it is found it will be appended (for ex. foo or foobar).
If (2.), a full match will be sought. If found it wil be appended to that section,
if not, the section will be created.
