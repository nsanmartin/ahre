Ahre can be launched without parameters (./ahre ) or specifying a url, ie:
> ./ahre file:///home/user/file.txt

If schema is not provided, https is assumed. So 
> ./ahre curl.se
assumes https://curl.se

In ahre, some tags are wrapped with specific chars:
+ anchors are wrapped within [] 
+ inputs are wrapped within {}
+ images are wrapped within ()
inside of which a number (base 36) identifies the element and its text is
displayed.

This chars are used to indicate specific commands like for example the
line `[1f*` is used to follow the link with id 1f (see later).

There are also shortcut commands aimed to save keystrokes such as `zf` (see
later).

You don't need to type the full command if there is no ambiguity. Hence,
`b` will be interpreted as `browse` (unless we implement a new doc command 
beginning with b).

Ahre commands
=============

url      :  shows the url of the current document
url <URL>:  sets current doc's url to <URL> and fetches it.
browse   :  generate text buffer for html document.
go <URL> :  sets the url of the current doc with <URL>, fetches and browses it
            (it does not show it).

colon (:) commands 
==================

Similarly to vim, commands starting with colon are buffer commands. After ':'
a range and a command are expected and the current line is set with the end of
the range.

:%p     : prints the whole buffer, sets current line with $.
:,+34p  : prints from the current line to 34 lines after it, moves current line 34.
:,$n    : print from current line until the last one, numbering the printed
          lines, move the current line.
:1p     : prints first line and set the current line.

:write <PATH> : saves current buffer in target (without the escape
                sequences bash uses for the colours).

:^      : repeat last range used (for example :^n after :2,5 will be :2,5n).

less than (<) commands:
======================

These are similar to (:) but operates on the source (html) buffer.

anchor commands ([)
===================

[<ID>' : shows content of anchor with id = <ID>
[<ID>* : sets current buffer with anchor's href url fetches and browses it.
[<ID>? : print information about element (attributes)

input commands ({)
==================

{<ID>=<VALUE>   : sets input with is = <ID> value with <VALUE>. This applies
                  only to text inputs and is used to fill inputs in forms.
{<ID>*<VALUE>   : submits button input with id=<ID>. Applied only to submit
                  inputs.
{<ID>?          : print information about element (attributes)

shortcuts
========

zf [<NUM>}] : shortcut to :,+<NUM>p but setting NUM so that it does not exceeds
              line count and prints a message when already reached the last
              line. If num is not given the last one provided in a previous
              call is used (with a default value if it was not called).
