# TODO
[ ] use trie for commands and include docs
[ ] document basic funtionality (usefull until cmd self docuemnt themselfs)
[ ] Unicode support
[ ] Support default and bright colour pallets (as w3m)
[ ] Log TAG not supported by browser when is the case
[ ] wrap lexbor functions with Err returning wrappers whenever possible
[ ] brwose properly anchors 
[ ] brwose properly blockquote 
[ ] brwose properly center 
[ ] implement ';' as cmd separator so that 'br;:%p' means first browse then print all (and multiline cmds)
[ ] implement def (or some other keyword) to define procedures
[ ] add command line option to read commands on startup
[ ] implement ranges for doc's cache's elements. Vg: [1,4' means show anchors 1 to 4
[ ] use libchafa for images
[ ] [isocline] set autocomplete with ahre commands 
[?] bug: image number invalid: check base
[ ] implement other curlopt setter in user interface
[ ] [libcurl] store cookies in file and make it configurable.
[~] [HTML] browse ul/li
[~] add cmd to show a and submit urls
[ ] implement hashi arl reset
[ ] separate more htmldoc init from draw
[ ] implement vi_process_line method that does not print (vi mode only prints on show)

# WILL NOT DO
[X] run test in github ci workflow (currently it does not find liblexbos.so.2): moving away from github

# DONE
[*] Accept files apart from urls
[*] count lines when appending to buf
[*] use array of line pointers in aebuf
[*] implement browse fn similar to lexbor/examples/lexbor/html/html2sexpr.c
